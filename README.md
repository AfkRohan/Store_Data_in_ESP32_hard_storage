# Store_Data_in_ESP32_hard_storage
It has projects on variety of ways by which one can store data in ESP32 such as SPIFFS,PREFERENCES.
The following file stores data in the esp32 spiffs memory as well as preference memory which is a JSON based storage.However,the following code would 
not be executed successfully if you do not have a tools folder with the required jar File in your arduino Files folder. Also you need to have a data folder 
with a test.txt file to write the data.
PROJECT DIR SHOULD BE LIKE:
    PROJECT
      ----> main.ino
      ---->data
           ----->text.ino
           
 IF YOU STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND,PLEASE REFER THE SPIFFS RELATED ARTICLE ON RANDOM NERDS OR SOME OTHER WEBSITES  OR YOU CAN REACH ME AT MY MAIL ID.
